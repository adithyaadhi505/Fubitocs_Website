dont use any emiojis in the complete code and project files keep it professional
and never insert any emojis in the code or project files
keep the files and code in very formated and strctrede like a real developer would do it and code in hand 
try to keep the code clean and professional
and add the necessary comments in the code wherever required
build like a read deployment readty code and project files and code mantality and perffect code structure and file structure

this is a start up idea so keep it perfect and professional
